This folder contains the cutout (simulated) images of the galaxies in each of the seven bands specified in the main code. 
As of now, the images should be named in the same way as in this example to be imported properly in the main code.

This folder also contains the photometric catalog with ID, RA and DEC of each object, 
and an ascii table with the indices of the segmentation region referring to the selected galaxy in each cutout (if you choose this option).
